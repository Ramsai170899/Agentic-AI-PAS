# Excalidraw Visual Scene Definitions: AI-Enhanced Insurance Underwriting Platform

### **Step 1 – Application Intake (95% Automated)**

The scene is framed within a unified UI theme using a corporate blue (#1E5AB4) primary color and a clean white (#FFFFFF) canvas with subtle gray (#F5F7FA) panel backgrounds. The ACME Life Insurance logo, a stylized shield with the acronym in bold, solid blue, is anchored in the top-left. A horizontal navigation bar spans the top, featuring six equal-width rectangular tabs labeled "1. Application Intake" (highlighted in solid blue with white text, a circular indicator with "1" overlaying it), "2. Documents," "3. Risk," "4. Comply," "5. Price," and "6. Issue" (all in medium gray #8C98A4). The central "Primary Applicant" panel has a soft drop shadow and rounded corners (8px radius), containing structured input boxes with light gray borders (#D0D7DE), populated text in dark charcoal (#2D3748), and dropdowns/radio buttons using the primary blue for selection states. The right-side document upload zone uses a dashed border (#1E5AB4, 2px) with an upload icon; completed files show in compact rectangular cards with a green (#10B981) progress bar and checkmark icon. The AI Assistant panel on the right is a distinct card with a light teal (#E0F2FE) background, containing status messages with green check and amber warning (#F59E0B) icons. A fixed footer action bar uses filled rectangular buttons: "Submit" (primary blue, enabled), "Save Draft" (light gray, disabled), "Request Clarification" (amber outline). A thin validation strip runs along the panel bottom with small, circular green/amber status icons and 10pt label text.

### **Step 2 – Document Processing (88% Automated)**

The navigation bar now highlights the second tab "2. Documents" in solid blue, with the tab indicator showing "2". The canvas background remains light gray (#F5F7FA). The left vertical filter panel uses rectangular pill-shaped buttons with the active "All Docs" filter in solid blue and inactive ones in light gray outline. The four document thumbnail cards are arranged in a 2x2 grid, each a square with rounded corners (6px), a document-type icon at the top, a label in bold 12pt, and a circular confidence score badge overlaying the corner in either green (≥90%), amber (75-89%), or red (≤74%). Status badges ("Verified," "Flagged") are small rounded rectangles placed bottom-center using green (#10B981) and red (#EF4444) fills. The central preview pane shows a selected document (Drivers License) mock-up with yellow (#FBBF24) semi-transparent bounding boxes highlighting fields. The adjacent data extraction table has a clean two-column layout with gray header row; mismatched fields are highlighted with a light red (#FEE2E2) background and a red "X" icon. The AI activity panel, right-aligned, uses the same teal card style from Step 1 with timestamped, bulleted log entries. The bottom control bar repeats the rectangular button style with "Mark Verified" (solid green), "Request Re-upload" (amber outline), and "Escalate Manually" (red outline).

### **Step 3 – Risk Assessment (75% Automated)**

The navigation highlights the third tab "3. Risk" in solid blue. The layout is a balanced dashboard using a 12-column grid. All risk panels—Medical, Financial, Lifestyle—share identical styling: white cards with a subtle 1px blue border (#BED7FE), a colored header strip (Medical: green #10B981, Financial: amber #F59E0B, Lifestyle: blue #3B82F6), and rounded corners (8px). Key metrics are displayed in large, bold 18pt dark gray (#1F2937) with descriptive labels in 11pt lighter gray (#6B7280). Visual risk gauges are horizontal bars with color-coded segments (Green-Low, Amber-Medium, Red-High). The central "Predictive Mortality Score" is a prominent donut chart in gradient blue, with an 82% central label and a confidence interval shown as a light gray band around it. The "Underwriting Class: Preferred" is displayed in a large, standalone badge using a dark green (#047857) fill with white text. The AI Assessment panel occupies the right sidebar, now with a light purple (#F3E8FF) background to differentiate it, using standard green check and red "X" icons. The Manual Override section at the bottom is distinctly separated by a light gray divider line, containing a toggle switch (OFF state shown as a gray circle in a gray track), a dropdown with default "Select..." text, and a notes field with placeholder text. Action buttons follow the established color coding: "Accept AI Score" (solid green), "Adjust Factors" (blue outline), "Senior Review" (amber outline).

### **Step 4 – Compliance Check (92% Automated)**

The fourth navigation tab "4. Comply" is highlighted. The central "Compliance Checklist" is presented as a compact table with alternating row shading (#F9FAFB). Each checklist row has a leading status icon: a solid green circle check for "Clear"/"Low Risk"/"Documented," an amber triangle with exclamation for "Review Required," and a gray dash for "Appropriate." The table uses thin horizontal dividers and left-aligned text in 12pt. The "Jurisdiction Rules" panel to the right is a blue-outlined card (#BFDBFE) with bulleted list items. The "Evidence" section is shown as a stack of three interactive, pill-shaped tags with document icons and light blue (#DBEAFE) backgrounds. The AI Summary panel returns to the standard teal background, its text including a bold percentage ("✓ 4/5 checks") and specific issue callouts in amber. The footer control bar is visually split: a left section labeled "Automated" in green 10pt text above the solid green "Approve Compliance" button, and a right section labeled "Manual Intervention" in amber 10pt text above the "Request Additional Signature" (amber outline) and "Route to Compliance Officer" (red outline) buttons, separated by a vertical gray divider line.

### **Step 5 – Decision & Pricing (65% Automated)**

The fifth navigation tab "5. Price" is highlighted. The top "Decision Summary" is a full-width banner card with a green gradient background (#10B981 to #34D399) and large, bold white text stating "RECOMMENDED: APPROVE." The "Standard Plus, No Exclusions" subtext is in a smaller white font. The "Pricing Breakdown" panel uses four distinct, aligned boxes: "Base Premium" (light gray fill), "Risk Loading" (light amber #FEF3C7 fill with + icon), "Multi-Policy Discount" (light green #D1FAE5 fill with - icon), and "Final Premium" (bold, dark blue border with a checkmark icon). The "Optional Riders" are shown as three toggleable cards with a switch control (ON state is blue, OFF is gray) and associated pricing. The "AI Analysis" panel is a compact, gray-bordered box with italicized explanatory text. The "Manual Override" section is contained in a clearly demarcated area with a light red (#FEE2E2) background, containing a dropdown set to "Approve" and an editable premium field with a pencil icon and a light gray (#E5E7EB) border. The notes field contains pre-filled text in 11pt gray. The action buttons at bottom follow size hierarchy: "Finalize Decision" is a large, solid blue button, flanked by medium-sized "Send for Review" (amber outline) and "Generate Offer Letter" (green outline) buttons.

### **Step 6 – Policy Issuance (90% Automated)**

The final navigation tab "6. Issue" is highlighted and also marked with a pulsing green dot. The entire progress bar is now filled with a solid green (#10B981) gradient to indicate completion. A celebratory banner spans the top with the message "Policy Ready for Final Signature—Issuance 90% Complete" on a light green (#D1FAE5) background with a green checkmark icon. The "Policy Generation" list shows three line items, each with a document icon and a status badge: "Generated" badges are solid green circles, "Pending Signature" is an amber outlined badge. The "Digital Signatures" section uses an avatar placeholder next to each role, with status badges inline—"Pending" in amber outline, "Completed" in solid green with a timestamp in small light gray text. The "Communication" box shows four events as circular icons (green filled for sent, amber half-filled for "in progress"). The "Payment" panel is a simple white card with a lock icon, last-four card digits, and a green "Authorization Hold Successful" badge. The AI Assistant panel uses the standard teal theme. The final action bar presents a prominent, large "Issue" button with a solid green fill and a document icon, alongside smaller, secondary "Resend Docs" (gray outline) and "Download Draft" (blue outline) buttons.
